Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?


# Solution
Let’s solve the Two Sum problem in Python. Given an array of integers nums and a target value, we need to find the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Here are a couple of approaches:

1. Brute Force Approach (O(n^2)):
Iterate through the array and for each element, check if there exists another element such that their sum equals the target.
This approach involves a nested loop and has a time complexity of O(n^2).
Here’s a sample implementation:
In this solution:

Python
```bash
def two_sum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
    raise ValueError("No two sum solution")

# Example usage
nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target1 = 9
print(two_sum(nums1, target1))  # Output: [0, 1]
```
2. Using a Hash Map (O(n)):
Create a dictionary (hash map) to store each element and its index.
While iterating through the array, calculate the complement (target minus the current element) and check if it exists in the dictionary.
If found, return the indices of the two elements.
This approach has a time complexity of O(n).
Here’s an implementation:

Python
```bash
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_to_index = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_to_index:
            return [num_to_index[complement], i]
        num_to_index[num] = i
    raise ValueError("No two sum solution")

# Example usage
nums2 = [3, 2, 4]
target2 = 6
print(two_sum(nums2, target2))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

We iterate through the array once.
For each element, we calculate its complement (target minus the element).
If the complement exists in our dictionary, we return the indices of the two elements.
Otherwise, we add the current element and its index to the dictionary.
If no solution is found, we raise an exception.
This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and is more efficient than the brute-force method.
